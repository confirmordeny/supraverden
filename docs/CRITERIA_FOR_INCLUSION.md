# Work in progress

The aim is to create a list of international organisations. To be clear this should not cover organisations that operate in multiple countries but that are creeated under the national law of one country. 

# Included
## International courts
Whilst in some cases international courts may be considered to form part of a larger organisation, we will list them separately. Part of the reason for this is that courts are or ought to be independent of other parts of the organisation under the principle of judicial independence.

## European agencies
Euopean agencies ave legal personality and are therefore included.
_“A European agency is a legally constituted European public body with its own legal personality. These agencies have been created by the EU with the aim of carrying out a technical, scientific or management mission relating to a specific area. [...] They are also known as decentralised agencies and respond to the desire of the EU to reduce the geographical concentration of EU activity.”_

## EU joint undertakings
EU joint undertakings have legal personality and are therefore included.
_“The joint undertakings shall have legal personality. In each of the Member States, they shall enjoy the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal persons under the laws of that Member State. They may, in particular, acquire or dispose of movable and immovable property and may be a party to legal proceedings.”_
Article 3(4) of [Council Regulation (EU) 2021/2085](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32021R2085)

## Specialized agencies of the UN
Specialized agencies of the UN have personality and are therefore included.
_"The specialized agencies shall possess juridical personality. They shall have the capacity (a) to contract, (b) to acquire and dispose of immovable and movable property, (c) to institute legal proceedings."_
Article II of the [Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the Specialized Agencies](https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1949/08/19490816%2010-43%20AM/Ch_III_2p-full%20text.pdf)

# Excluded

## Defunct organisations
Defunct organisations that still exist legally but are thought to be completely inactive are not generally included for practical reasons. The focus is on active entities.

## Treaties not resulting in a new organisation
Often countries enter into formal agreements to co-operate but no new organisation is created. These will not be included. As an example, AUKUS is an alliance between three countries (Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States) but the treaty does not create a new legal person. 

## Entities established by informal agreements
Organisations that are established through informal agreements such as memoranda of understanding (MOU) are not included. For example, the [Eastern Africa Power Pool](https://eappool.org/) is a regional institution set up through a memorandum of understanding between members (and another between utility oprators). MOUs are not legally binding.
