## International courts
Whilst in some cases international courts may be considered to form part of a larger organisation, we will list them separately. Part of the reason for this is that courts are or ought to be independent of other parts of the organisation under the principle of judicial independence.

## EU joint undertakings
EU joint undertakings have legal personality and are therefore included.
_“The joint undertakings shall have legal personality. In each of the Member States, they shall enjoy the most extensive legal capacity accorded to legal persons under the laws of that Member State. They may, in particular, acquire or dispose of movable and immovable property and may be a party to legal proceedings.”_
