# Research

This repo is the product of many hours of research. Some of the sources consulted are listed below. 

Where I have included a source in this list this does not necessary mean that I have captured all 
of the organisations listed that meet the repo's [criteria for inclusion](CRITERIA_FOR_INCLUSION.md).
