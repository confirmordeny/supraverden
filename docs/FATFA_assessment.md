The FATFA definition of international organisation is as follows:
> International organisations are entities established by formal political agreements
between their member States that have the status of international treaties; their existence 
is recognised by law in their member countries; and they are not treated as
resident institutional units of the countries in which they are located. 
Examples of international organisations include the United Nations and affiliated 
international organisations such as the International Maritime Organisation;
regional international organisations such as the Council of Europe,
institutions of the European Union, the organisation for Security and 
Cooperation in Europe and the organisation of American States; 
military international organisations such as the North Atlantic Treaty organisation,
and economic organisations such as the World Trade Organisation or the Association 
of Southeast Asian Nations, etc."
